            <li>a stick of butter</li>
            <li>a medium onion chopped</li>
            <li>1 to 2 cups of mixed vegetables (corn,carrots,peas)</li>
            <li>1 1/2 pounds of ground beef</li>

            <li>1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Recipe Instructions</h3>
    </div>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Boil the Potatoes</strong>: Place the peeled and quartered potatoes in medium sized pot. 
                Cover with at least an inch of cold water. Add a teaspoon of salt. Bring to a boil, reduce to a 
                simmer, and cook until tender (about 20 minutes)</li>
            <li><strong>Preheat the Oven</strong>: Preheat your oven to 400 degrees Fahrenheit</li>
            <li><strong>Saute the Vegetables</strong>: While the potatoes are cooking, melt 4 tablespoons of the 
                butter in a large sauté pan on medium heat. Add the chopped onions and cook until tender, about 
                6 to 10 minutes. If you are including vegetables, add them according to their cooking time. Carrots 
                should be cooked with the onions, because they take as long to cook as the onions do. If you are including 
                peas or corn, add them toward the end of the cooking of the onions, or after the meat starts to cook, as 
                they take very little cooking time</li>
            <li><strong>Add the Meat then Sauce and Broth</strong>: Add ground beef to the pan with the onions and vegetables. 
                Cook until no longer pink. Drain the pan of excess fat, if necessary (anything more than 1 tablespoon). Season 
                with salt and pepper Add the Worcestershire sauce and beef broth. Bring the broth to a simmer and reduce heat 
                to low. Cook uncovered for 10 minutes, adding more beef broth if necessary to keep the meat from drying out. 
                Taste the cooked filling and, if needed, add more salt, pepper, Worcestershire, or other seasonings of your choice.</li>
            <li><strong>Mashed the Cooked Potatoes</strong>: When the potatoes are done cooking (a fork can easily pierce), 
                remove them from the pot and place them in a bowl with the remaining 4 tablespoons of butter. Mash with a fork or 
                potato masher, taste, and adjust seasonings how you see fit.</li>
            <li><strong>Layer Everything Together</strong>: Spread the cooked filling in an even layer in a large baking dish 
                Spread the mashed potatoes over the top of the ground beef. Rough up the surface of the mashed potatoes with a 
                fork so there are peaks that will get well browned. You can even use a fork to make creative designs in the mashed potatoes.</li>
            <li><strong>Bake in Oven</strong>: Place in a 400°F oven and cook until browned and bubbling, about 30 minutes. If necessary, broil 
                for the last few minutes to help the surface of the mashed potatoes brown</li>
            <li><strong>Let it Cool Down and Enjoy</strong>: Let your freshly baked pie cool off for at least 20-30 minutes and enjoy.</li>
        </ol>

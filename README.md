HTML Foundations Project
Pre project completion:The point behind this project is to showcase that I've 
understood and processed the basic concepts of HTML
and can put them into practice making a basic recipe page
Post project completion:It felt nice putting what I've learned these past few days into practice. I really love the ability to create something right in front of me and the feeling I get when I figure out something new or correct a mistake is exhilarating.
